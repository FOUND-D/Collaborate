# Daily Task Recap - January 28, 2026

## 1. Premium Authentication UI Overhaul
**Goal:** Create a modern, visually stunning entry point for the application.

*   **Reconstructed Sign-In/Sign-Up Pages (`AuthLayout`):**
    *   Transformed the basic login screen into a **high-end, centered Glass Card** design.
    *   Implemented a rich dark background (`#050505`) with subtle radial gradients (blue/violet) for a professional SaaS aesthetic.
    *   **Effect:** The "Welcome Back" card now floats beautifully on the screen with blur effects (`backdrop-filter`) and entry animations.

*   **Fixed "Black Screen" Layout Bug:**
    *   **Issue:** The login page was collapsing to 0 width due to flexbox constraints, appearing as a blank black screen.
    *   **Fix:** Updated `App.css` to enable `flex: 1` for the `.auth-page-wrapper` and enforced `100vw/100vh` positioning in `AuthLayout.css` to guarantee full-screen coverage regardless of parent container behavior.

*   **Refactored App Layout (`App.jsx`):**
    *   Updated the main routing logic to **conditionally hide the Sidebar** on authentication pages (`/login`, `/register`).
    *   This ensures users have a distraction-free, dedicated entry point without navigation clutter.

## 2. Sidebar & Navigation Improvements
**Goal:** Streamline navigation and improve user experience.

*   **Streamlined Menu:**
    *   Removed the redundant **"Profile" tab** from the main sidebar navigation list to reduce clutter.

*   **Integrated Profile Access:**
    *   **Functionality:** Made the **User Avatar** (and name) in the sidebar footer clickable.
    *   **Interaction:** Clicking the avatar now navigates directly to the `/profile` screen.
    *   **Visuals:** Added CSS cues (pointer cursor, hover background change) to clearly indicate interactivity.

## 3. Code Quality & Repository Management
*   **Clean Code:** Resolved syntax errors and CSS linting issues that arose during the rapid refactoring phases.
*   **Version Control:** 
    *   Successfully committed all changes to the `master` branch.
    *   Pushed distinct commits for layout fixes, design overhauls, and navigation updates to `https://github.com/ArinDixit06/Collaborate.git`.

# Daily Task Recap - February 12, 2026

## 1. Frontend Enhancements
**Goal:** Elevate the user experience with modern dashboards, better task management, and polished UI components.

*   **Dashboard Upgrade (`HomeScreen`):**
    *   Added a dynamic **"Good Morning/Evening"** greeting.
    *   Implemented a **Stats Grid** showing real-time counts for Active Projects, Pending Tasks, and Completion Rate.
    *   Applied **Glassmorphism** styling to cards for a premium look.

*   **Task Management (`TaskScreen`):**
    *   Added **Status Filters** (All, To Do, In Progress, Completed, Blocked).
    *   Created specific **Empty States** for each filter view.
    *   Improved the visual list layout.

*   **Global UI Improvements:**
    *   **Custom Alerts (`Message.jsx`):** Replaced default alerts with animated, custom-styled toast messages with icons.
    *   **Animations:** Added entry animations for cards and lists.

## 2. Authentication System Fixes
**Goal:** Ensure seamless and robust user session management.

*   **Single Sign-in Synchronization:**
    *   Implemented real-time **Cross-Tab Sync** in `App.jsx`. Login/Logout actions now reflect instantly across all open tabs.
*   **Registration Redirect Fix:**
    *   Fixed a bug where already logged-in users could access the registration page. They are now automatically redirected.
