High-fidelity mobile app UI/UX design, "Project Collaboration Dashboard" screen. 

STYLE & ATMOSPHERE:
Modern Glassmorphism aesthetic. Clean, airy, and translucent. The design should feature frosted glass effects (background blur) layered over a soft, abstract gradient background. The lighting is soft and diffuse, mimicking high-end studio photography.

COLOR PALETTE:
Primary: White and translucent whites (opacity 20% to 80%).
Accents: Soft pastel gradients blending Lavender (#E6E6FA), Mint Green (#98FF98), and Sky Blue (#87CEEB).
Text: Dark slate grey (#2F4F4F) for headers, cool grey for body text to maintain contrast without harsh blacks.

KEY UI ELEMENTS:

1. THE TIMELINE (Vertical Layout):
- A sleek, vertical progress line on the left side with a soft gradient stroke.
- "Active Stage" is represented by a floating glass card with a glowing, vibrant pill-shaped indicator. 
- "Future Stages" are semi-transparent, matte-finish elements.
- "Completed Stages" have a subtle checkmark with a soft green glow.
- The connection lines between nodes should look like illuminated fiber optics, but subtle.

2. TEAM MEMBERS SECTION (Horizontal Scroll):
- Located at the top or within a specific task card.
- A row of 3D-style circular avatars.
- The avatars sit inside "glass bubbles" with a subtle white specular highlight.
- An "Add Member" button that is a dashed circle with a frosted matte finish.
- Overlapping avatars (stacking effect) to show density, with a "+3" indicator for extra members.

DETAILS & POLISH:
- Deep drop shadows (diffuse) to create elevation and depth between layers.
- 24px rounded corners on all cards.
- Typography: "Inter" or "SF Pro Display" font family (Clean Sans-Serif).
